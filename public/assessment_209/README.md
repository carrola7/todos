## Assumptions

* The nav bar titles of 'All Todos' and 'Completed' are not links

* The items in the list of completed todos in the nav bar are also links.

* The cursor changes to a pointer when hovering over an item in the nav menu

* Items in the main page turn blue when hovered even when they have been completed

* The month and year select elements have a gray font in the psd file. I am making an assumption that these fields are required.

* The requirements state that the modal should be horizontally centred in the main area yet the psd file
shows the main area with a right hand margin, resulting in the modal located slightly left of center. I was aware 
of this but decided to center it according to the written requirements.
